                    <h3>Career</h3>
                    <p>
                        My career started in the defense industry for
                        <a href="https://www.northropgrumman.com" target="new">Northrop Grumman</a>
                        through internships during college and a full-time position for a little
                        under a year from 2018 to 2019; while there, I worked on software
                        infrastructure tools and early stage prototype analytics. In August of
                        2019, I left Northrop Grumman to try my hand in the trading industry with
                        <a href="https://www.belvederetrading.com" target="new">Belvedere Trading LLC</a>
                        as a software engineer. I got to see first-hand
                        the kind of work traders do and worked on a few applications to help
                        them do their job faster and easier. Unfortunately, I was laid off in
                        March 2020 due to COVID-19; I'm currently seeking employment while
                        working on my personal projects.

                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <p>
                        I went to the
                        <a href="https://www.imsa.edu" target="new">Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy</a>
                        for high school. From there, I continued on to
                        <a href="https://www.illinois.edu" target="new">UIUC</a>
                        to complete a Bachelor's of Science in Engineering Physics.
                        Now, I'm working on my Master's of Science in Computer Science
                        (with a concentration in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence)
                        through
                        <a href="https://www.gatech.edu" target="new">Georgia Tech</a>'s
                        renowned
                        <a href="https://www.omscs.gatech.edu" target="new">OMSCS</a>
                        program. Courses I've taken include Artificial Intelligence (CS 6601), 
                        Robotics: AI Techniques (CS 7638), Reinforcement Learning (CS 7642),
                        and Simulation (ISYE 6644).

                   <h3>Interests</h3>
                   <p>
                       I've always had a strong inclination towards mathematics, but wanted to
                       find my own balance between theory and application. Pure theoretical
                       math felt too out of touch with reality, but I found that going straight
                       into crunching numbers would be too mind-numbing. Having grown up
                       around computers (my dad works as a database administrator) and being
                       naturally lazy, I felt like the best way to apply myself would be to
                       come up with mathematical models for the real world--but have the
                       computer do all the heavy lifting and sort out the finer details.
                       This mindset led me to take in interest in not only the ever-popular
                       ML/AI, but also modeling and simulation. And thanks to my time spent
                       at Belvedere, I've started to also develop an interest in applying
                       AI agents and algorithms to the stock market.
